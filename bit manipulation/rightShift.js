//For left shift we are using ">>" this operators >> thats indicating the left shifting of bits
let l = 2;
console.log(l >> 1); // here we are doing left shift of 2 by one so it will be change from "0010" = 2 to "0010" = 1

//example:-
console.log(500 >> 1); //ans = 250 // you can also to right shifting by deviding by 2
